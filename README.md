# Hey there 👋

Welcome on my github profile, I am a French high school student learning code. I'm yet a self taught developer, however i would like to make some cybersecurity studies. I have been coding since 2018 and am interested in everything in the web development however i'm focusing on javascript. You can contact me from the email of my github account ! ⌨️
